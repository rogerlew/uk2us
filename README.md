# uk2us

`uk2us` is a simple command-line utility for converting British spellings to their American counterparts.  
It wraps the extensive word lists from [HoldOffHunger/convert-british-to-american-spellings](https://github.com/HoldOffHunger/convert-british-to-american-spellings) and adds a few conveniences:

- In-place rewriting of one or more files, with atomic writes to avoid partial updates.
- `stdin` / `stdout` mode for use in pipelines (`uk2us -`).
- Optional override rules so you can skip or force specific replacements without touching the upstream dataset.

## Installation

1. Install the PHP CLI (`sudo apt install php-cli` on Ubuntu/Debian).  
2. Clone this repository and change into it.
3. Make the script executable: `chmod +x uk2us`.

## Configuration

Custom substitutions live in `config/uk2us_rules.json`.  
Edit the JSON to add:

- `"skip_replacements"`: words you never want converted (e.g., `"schemata"`).
- `"forced_mappings"`: British→American overrides that must always run (e.g., `"modelling": "modeling"`).

When running the script from a symlink, it automatically resolves back to the repo to find this file.  
To use a different rules file, set `UK2US_RULES_FILE=/path/to/file.json`.

## Usage

```bash
# Rewrite one or more files in place
uk2us README.md notes/*.md

# Pipe mode: read British spellings from stdin, emit American spellings to stdout
cat summary.txt | uk2us -
```

The command exits with a non-zero status when it encounters unreadable or unwritable files.

## Symlinking

After installation you can make the tool globally available:

```bash
sudo ln -sf "$(pwd)/uk2us" /usr/local/bin/uk2us
```

The script detects the real path of the symlink so it can still locate the bundled `lib/` and `config/` directories.



# US/UK Spelling Converter

*You* provide the text, with either US/UK-spelling.

*We* return the same text, converted to either system.

We have you covered -- for about 20,000 words.

## Functionality

### General Behavior

_How in general does it work?_

* **Exact / Error-Resistant**
    * British/American Spelling Converter uses regular expression checking with `/\b$word\b/`, so this makes it impossible to corrupt words.
    * For example, "Ax" becomes "Axe", but "Axiomatic" will remain as "Axiomatic", and cannot become "Axeiomatic", which would be incorrect.
* **Fast / Efficient**
    * Every mass-replace is done within a single `preg_replace()` call, using arrays as arguments
    * This means that the script will finish much sooner.
* **Reliable / Atomic / Deterministic**
    * American-ize/British-ify will not corrupt meaning.
    * For example, 'discus' and 'diskus' have reverse meanings in US/UK, swapping them in or out will cause the text to change each time you "Americanize" or "Britishify" it.  So, we don't do these types of swaps.

### Precise Behavior - Use Cases

_How exactly does it work?_

* Only all lower case, all upper case, or first letter capitalized versions are converted.
    * Example: American=>English, "axe"=>"ax", "AXE" would be converted to "AX" or vice versa, but "AxE would not be converted to Ax".
* Apostrophes are treated as word boundaries.
    * Example: American=>English, "axe"=>"ax", "the ax's handle" would be converted to "the axe's handle."
* Only precisely whole, known words are converted.
    * Example: American=>English, "axe"=>"ax", this will not convert "axed" to axd", because the "-d" concluding character indicates that it is an entirely different word.
* Dashes are treated as word boundaries only when not preceded and followed by a dash.
    * Example: American=>English, "affecteffect=>affect-effect", this will convert "the affect-effect of it" to "the affecteffect of it", but it will not convert "these every-night-affect-effect-happenings are" to "these every-every-night-affecteffect-happenings are", as the dash here implies new meaning than when solely alone.
* British alternates are handled.
    * Example: American=>English, "amoebas"=>["amoebae", "amebas", "amebae",], if converting to English, "amoebas" will be replaced with "amoebae", the most contemporary term, and if converting to American, "amoebae", "amebas", etc., will all be converted to the single, American equivalent.
    
_Some test sentences..._

The neighbour walked to the theatre's centre, manoeuvred about the sabre, and proceeded to reconnoitre the sepulchre in ochre.

The rumour spread that splendour and flavour were affected by our behaviour, so walk a metre in my mitre while carrying a litre of nitre.

The connexion with industrialisation remains with the municipalisation of the calibre of the fibre of the spectre, not with the meagre and sombre saltpetre with all its colour and honour.

## Code Structure and Design

### Coding Languages

The entire project is coded in the following...

* *PHP* - For processing the text and storing the US/UK words.

### Exclude List

_How do you avoiding adding words that would break the deterministic / atomistic model of functionality?_

We do this with an exclude list, which also details the conflict in the words themselves.
